# self-hosted disposable email system

This disposable email solution can be hosted on your own standard PHP-webhoster. All you need is PHP with imap extension and an imap account with catch-all. The system is as simple as possible, with minimal codebase and complexity. 

*Note: This is alphatested software, do not use it in production, it may lose your mails and people may gain access to your mails. There are still unsolved problems.*

Note: This is the IMAP version without database and that does not need "pipe to command". See also alternative script at https://github.com/synox/disposable-email

## Usage
When accessing the web-app a random email address is generated for you. The page will reload until emails have arrived. You can delete emails and see the original sourcecode.
